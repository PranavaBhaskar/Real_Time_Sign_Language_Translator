# Real_Time_Sign_Language_Translator

About the Project: 
The "Real-Time Sign Language Detection" project aims to develop a robust system for recognizing and translating sign language gestures in real-time using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The system leverages MediaPipe Holistic for precise keypoint extraction from video frames, capturing essential hand, face, and body poses. These keypoints are then processed into sequences and fed into a deep neural network architecture built with LSTM layers using TensorFlow and Keras. 
      The project addresses significant communication barriers faced by the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities by providing an accessible and efficient method for sign language translation. The system's real-time capabilities enable immediate feedback, enhancing communication fluidity and inclusivity. 
      Key objectives include optimizing model performance for accuracy and speed, ensuring robustness across different environmental conditions, and developing a user-friendly interface for seamless integration into everyday devices. This project contributes to the advancement of assistive technologies, fostering greater accessibility and understanding between individuals using sign language and the broader community. Future enhancements will focus on expanding gesture vocabulary, improving model generalization, and enhancing usability on diverse platforms.
